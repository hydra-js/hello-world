    <h1>Welcome to Hydra-JS!</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>This the welcome page for Hydra-JS application.</p>
    <p>This file is placed in public directory, so it will be served as static file.</p>
    <p>If you want to add more static pages, you can add them in the public directory, and they will be served as static
      files.</p>

    <p>This file serves for root route (::/), so it will be served as root page.</p>

    <h3>Important Notes</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>This file is optional (in case of using only public directory for static files)</li>
      <li>This file takes precedence over the routes, so if you want to add dynamic content, you should add it in the
        routes directory, and remove this file.</li>
      <li>public directory is by default the root directory for static files. You can put any assets in this directory,
        and they will be served as static files.</li>
      <li>This file is only used for demonstration purposes. You can remove this file and add your own static files to
        the public directory.</li>
