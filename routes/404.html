  <p>Oops! You've reached a page that doesn't exist in this Hydra-JS application.</p>
  
  <p>This 404 page is a dynamic route, allowing for customization using Handlebars syntax.</p>
  
  <p>While this file is optional, it's recommended to keep a custom 404 page for a better user experience.</p>
  
  <p>Don't worry! You can <a href="/">return to the homepage</a> or try searching for the content you were looking for.</p>
